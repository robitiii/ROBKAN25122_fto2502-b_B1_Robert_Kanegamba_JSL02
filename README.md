# Overview
This project involves implementing a JavaScript-based task entry system where users can input two tasks with complete details, ensuring data consistency and validation. The system will guide users through entering valid task titles, descriptions, and statuses, enforcing correct formatting while maintaining code clarity and maintainability.

# Project Structure
## The project is structured as follows:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for handling user interactions and validating task data.
- `readme.md`: This file serves as the project's README, providing an overview of the project's purpose, structure, and instructions for using it.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains styles for the application's UI elements.
- `jason.js`: A JavaScript file that contains the logic for handling tasks, including task creation.

# How to Use
## Instructions :
---
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine or download the project files and extract the files to your desired location.
   
2. Open the `index.html` file on your vstudio code editor , open your live server to  view it on your browser.
   
3. A prompt will appear when the file is finally running on the browser, now you can start 
   
4. Entering data by inputting complete details, like "todo" , "doing", "done" on the prompt and then press enter.
   
5. The system will validate the input and display that you have entered valid data related to the entered data.
   
6. If you enter invalid data, the system will display an error message (" invalid status. please enter 'todo', 'doing' or 'doing'.") indicating that the entered data is invalid.
   
7. If you canceled the prompt, the system will display an error message (" no tasks completed let's get to work!")

8. Once the user has entered valid data for both tasks, the system will display a success message (" Title: Make corrections to JSL01...") indicating that the tasks have been successfully created in your browser in the browsers console.
